# Code-Quize-Fun

## Description

Code Quiz Fun is an interactive multiple-choice quiz game where you can test your coding knowledge by selecting the correct answers to earn a higher score.

## User Story

As a developer, I have designed a user-friendly program. When you're ready to start the game, simply follow the instructions to begin. Once started, a timer will count down from 60 seconds as you navigate through four questions. Each correct answer leads to the next question, while incorrect answers result in a 15-second time penalty. The final score is calculated based on the remaining time. After completing all questions or when time runs out, you can enter your initials to record your score, which will be saved to the database. You also have the option to delete records. Refreshing the page allows you to start a new game. Enjoy the experience!
